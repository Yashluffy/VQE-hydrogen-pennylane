# Using a VQE to Find the Ground State of a Hydrogen Molecule

Drug discovery is a crucial aspect of modern medicine, with the potential to save countless lives and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the world. From treating diseases to managing chronic conditions, the development of new and effective drugs is essential to advancing healthcare and ensuring a healthier future for generations to come.

The key to success for drug discovery lies in the intricate dance between small molecules and macromolecules. But as the complexity of these interactions grows, so too does the challenge of analyzing the massive amounts of data generated by molecular simulations.

Classical methods for calculating the ground state energy of a molecule are limited in their accuracy and efficiency, especially for large molecules. The use of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) offers a promising solution to this problem. VQE is a quantum algorithm designed to find the lowest energy state of a system by optimizing the parameters of a quantum circuit.

In this project I develop + code a VQE to find the ground state of a hydrogen molecule using Xanadu's Pennylane software.
